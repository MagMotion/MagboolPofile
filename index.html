        <h3>motion designer / Video editor</h3>
        <p>
          In today's world, finding ways to connect with others is more
          important than ever. As a motion designer and video editor, I've
          dedicated my career to storytelling. Art and creativity can break down
          barriers and create a deeper connection with the people we work with.
          Through a video, a still frame, or even a simple animation, I strive
          to tell stories that engage and inspire others. Telling stories is one
          of the oldest and most effective ways of communicating. They can
          educate, entertain, and even change the way people think. In addition,
          stories have the power to bring us together in a world that is often
          divided. As a storyteller, I am responsible for using my skills to
          inspire positive change and help build bridges between people
